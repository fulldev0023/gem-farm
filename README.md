It consists of 3 separate but inter-related programs described in detail below.

# Gem Bank 🏦

Useful for individuals / groups of friends / DAOs who want a single convenient place for all of their NFTs to live in.

Used to offer a yield-bearing facility to loyal gem stakers.

# Gem Sharder 🔨

Used to shard gems into fungible tokens (shards).
